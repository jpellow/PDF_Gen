This "PDF" Generator is supposed to take user input via the inquirer and generae a PDF. This is done by using a template literal, generating an HTML page then converting that page to PDF.

I was unable to get the PDF side working, I kept getting "document is not defined"

I was also unable to get the google maps api done do to time constraints.
